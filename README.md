# Bubble Trouble

Self-study project 2 - My first Flutter game Bubble Trouble Game

## Rule

Player need to control the character and hit the bubble with missiles to win. The player loses when the bubble hits the player.

## Control

1. Keyboard (lef, right arrow and space).

2. Buttons on UI.

## Getting Started

1. Download the project and use ``` flutter run ``` to run the project.

2. Press the play button to start the game.

3. Move left/right by using left/right arrow button on UI or left/right arrow button on keyboard (for browser).

4. Fire Missile by using up arrow button on UI or space button on keyboard (for browser).

## Future Update
Improve UI/UX and add more different difficulty levels

## What did I get from this project?

First attempt to
- use a rounded rectangle - ClipRRect
- use decoration type
- use Icons data type - Icons.arrow_upward

More understanding about 
- layout - Expanded(flex:), Center()
- aligment -  MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly

Learned how to 
- use Timer - Timer.periodic()
- read data from keyboard - RawKeyboardListener()
- pop up a alert - showDialog()
- remove the debug banner ðŸ¤£ - debugShowCheckedModeBanner
- add gesture detect to a widget - GestureDetector()
- move the character - Alignment(X,Y)
